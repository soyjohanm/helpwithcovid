Connecting Medial Supplies to Medical Entities in Need 

Description

    Connecting individuals that have excess medical supplies ( gloves, masks, santizer, etc ) to medical entities in need of them. It's clear that there's going to be a shortage in many hospitals and clinics around the USA ( and world ) and there are more individuals than you'd think ( or entities not using their supplies ) that have extra supplies with no clear destination to send them.
